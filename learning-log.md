A service is an instance of a class that you can make available to any part of your application using Angular's dependency injection system.

Services are the place where you share data between parts of your application.

Multiple components can leverage the same service.

Dependencies are services or objects that a class needs to perform its function.

Dependency injection is a coding pattern in which a class asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.
