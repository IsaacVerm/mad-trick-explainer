# mad-trick-explainer

A magician never reveals his secrets but this web app does exactly that.

## Prototypes

Planning on at first 4 prototypes:

1) show tricks by magician
2) have a detail page per magician
3) fetch some tricks (e.g. from Wikipedia)
4) let the user add his own magician

This roughly follows the [try it Angular tutorial](https://angular.io/start).

## Scaffolding

Make sure to have `node`, `npm` and `ng` [installed](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

Run `ng new mte`.

Serve with `ng serve` (from within the app).

Generate new component with `ng generate component`.

## Content of the app

Tricks were taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_magic_tricks) or [here](https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/G.O.B.%27s_illusions) in case of G.O.B.
