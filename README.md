A magician never reveals his secrets but this web app does exactly that.

## Prototypes

Planning on at first 4 prototypes:

1) show tricks by magician
2) have a detail page per magician
3) fetch some tricks (e.g. from Wikipedia)
4) let the user add his own magician

This roughly follows the [try it Angular tutorial](https://angular.io/start).
